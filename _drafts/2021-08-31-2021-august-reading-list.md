I decided to try taking a bit of inspiration from the [Jo Walton's Reading List series](https://www.tor.com/tag/jo-walton-reads/), who publicly keeps notes on books she has read. I won't be tracking everything I read related to coding (and will include some video and podcasts). Instead, what I am going to try is keeping notes on things I come across that stick with me, or push me to experiment with a new library or technique.
